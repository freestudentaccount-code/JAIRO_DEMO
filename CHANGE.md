**Prompt:** Let's go ahead and create an emoji Space Evaders game that is similar to Space Invaders. I want to have ships, aliens and different layers. Each time you complete a level, add a timer showing high scores ahead of this. We want to make sure that this is very fun and interactive game that people are able to register their names for their highest scores. We want to go ahead and have it have many visual effects. Explosions, glowing effects, a star field in the background. Make sure that we use a full keyboard control for left and right arrow keys, P to pause and the spacebar to shoot.

**Reasoning:**
This change creates the initial file structure for the Emoji Space Evaders game. It includes the HTML for the game canvas and high score display, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

**Changed:**
- Created `index.html` to serve as the entry point for the game.
- Created `style.css` to style the game elements.
- Created `game.js` to contain the game logic.
- Created `CHANGE.md` to track changes.
