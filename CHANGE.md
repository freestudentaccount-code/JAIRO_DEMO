**Prompt:** Let's go ahead and create an emoji Space Evaders game that is similar to Space Invaders. I want to have ships, aliens and different layers. Each time you complete a level, add a timer showing high scores ahead of this. We want to make sure that this is very fun and interactive game that people are able to register their names for their highest scores. We want to go ahead and have it have many visual effects. Explosions, glowing effects, a star field in the background. Make sure that we use a full keyboard control for left and right arrow keys, P to pause and the spacebar to shoot.

**Reasoning:**
This change creates the initial file structure for the Emoji Space Evaders game. It includes the HTML for the game canvas and high score display, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

**Changed:**
- Created `index.html` to serve as the entry point for the game.
- Created `style.css` to style the game elements.
- Created `game.js` to contain the game logic.
- Created `CHANGE.md` to track changes.

**Prompt:** I need to be able to restart the gameplay, give me a nice fun button that will encourage me to play again, period. I also want to be able to play this from an iPhone and Android please. Add this functionality.

**Reasoning:**
This change adds a "Play Again" button and touch controls for mobile devices. The game over screen now presents a "Play Again" button. When a high score is achieved, the "Play Again" button is shown after the user saves their score. Touch controls for left, right, and shoot are added for mobile devices.

**Changed:**
- Added a "Game Over" modal with a "Play Again" button to `index.html`.
- Added touch control elements to `index.html`.
- Added CSS for the touch controls in `style.css`.
- Updated `game.js` to handle the "Play Again" functionality and touch events.
- Modified the `endGame` function to show the correct modal.
- Added a `resetGame` function to restart the game.

**Prompt:** I don't see a playagain option. I did reload and tried flushing My cash.

**Reasoning:**
The user is reporting that the "Play Again" option is not appearing. The previous logic would only show the high score modal if the score was greater than the lowest high score, but it didn't handle the case where the score was not a high score. This change ensures that if the score is not a high score, the "Game Over" modal with the "Play Again" button is displayed. It also ensures that the high score modal is only shown for scores greater than 0.

**Changed:**
- Modified the `endGame` function in `game.js` to correctly display either the high score modal or the game over modal.
- Removed the now redundant `checkHighScore` function.

**GitHub Commit Summary:**
fix: Ensure play again option is always available

Fixes a bug where the "Play Again" button would not appear if the player did not achieve a high score. The game over screen is now correctly displayed when the score is not a high score.

**Prompt:** When the aliens reach the bottom, the game level is over.

**Reasoning:**
This change adds a condition to end the game if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen. This is a standard feature in Space Invaders-style games and adds a sense of urgency for the player.

**Changed:**
- Added a check in `game.js` to determine if any alien has reached the bottom of the canvas. If so, the game ends.

**GitHub Commit Summary:**

**Prompt:** For my sake while developing, can we include a version in the lower right hand corner of the screen so I know that the update? Is active.

**Reasoning:**
This change adds a version number to the bottom right corner of the screen. This will help the user confirm that they are running the latest version of the game and that their changes have been applied.

**Changed:**
- Added a `div` with the id `version` to `index.html` to display the version number.
- Added CSS in `style.css` to position the version number in the lower right corner.

**Prompt:** Add a synthesizer to go ahead and generate awesome sounds. Have something fun for lasers, explosions. Different aliens have different sounds when they get hit and make it fun when you complete a level, do a special sound or a voice that says next level when the game is over. Say game over when the new high score is reached. Say something like new high score.

**Reasoning:**
This change adds sound effects and voice synthesis to the game to make it more engaging. It uses the Tone.js library for synthesized sounds and the browser's built-in SpeechSynthesis API for voice.

**Changed:**
- Added the Tone.js library to `index.html`.
- Updated the version number in `index.html`.
- In `game.js`:
    - Initialized Tone.js synthesizers.
    - Created functions to play sounds for lasers, explosions, and alien hits.
    - Created functions to speak "Next Level", "Game Over", and "New High Score".
    - Integrated these sound and voice functions into the game logic (shooting, explosions, leveling up, game over).

**Prompt:** [User provided console errors indicating AudioContext was not allowed to start]

**Reasoning:**
The user has provided console errors indicating that the `AudioContext` from Tone.js is not being allowed to start without a user gesture. This is a common browser security feature to prevent websites from auto-playing audio. To fix this, I am adding an event listener that starts the `AudioContext` when the user first clicks anywhere on the page.

**Changed:**
- Updated the version number in `index.html`.
- In `game.js`, added a `click` event listener to the body that calls `Tone.start()` to resume the `AudioContext` upon the first user interaction.

**Modified Files:**
- `d:\Development\git_source\Jairo_Demo\index.html`
- `d:\Development\git_source\Jairo_Demo\game.js`
- `d:\Development\git_source\Jairo_Demo\CHANGE.md`

**GitHub Commit Summary:**
fix: Resume AudioContext on user gesture

Fixes an issue where audio would not play due to browser auto-play policies. The AudioContext is now started after the first user click on the page.

**Prompt:** Gameplay does not work on an iPhone. Please fix this.

**Reasoning:**
The user is reporting that the game is not working on iPhone. A likely cause is that the audio context is not being started correctly on iOS devices, which have strict auto-play policies. The previous fix only listened for a `click` event, which may not be sufficient for touch devices. This change adds a `touchstart` event listener to ensure the audio context is started on touch-based devices like iPhones.

**Changed:**
- Updated the version number in `index.html`.
- In `game.js`, added a `touchstart` event listener to the body to start the `AudioContext` on touch devices. The `click` listener is kept for desktop compatibility. Both listeners are removed after the first interaction.

**GitHub Commit Summary:**
fix: Improve iOS compatibility for audio

Adds a 'touchstart' event listener to ensure the AudioContext is properly initialized on iOS devices, which require a user gesture to start audio.

**Prompt:** We still don't have a version working with the iPhone. Here's a screenshot.

**Reasoning:**
The user provided a screenshot showing the game loaded on iPhone but the controls are not working. The issue is likely that iOS Safari requires specific event handling for touch events. The touch events need to have preventDefault() called to prevent the browser from handling them (like scrolling), and they need to be marked as non-passive events. I've also added visual indicators to the touch controls to make them more obvious on mobile devices.

**Changed:**
- Updated the version number in `index.html` to v1.0.8.
- In `game.js`, modified all touch event listeners to call `preventDefault()` and set `{ passive: false }` to ensure iOS Safari properly handles them.
- In `style.css`, added visual indicators (arrows and rocket emoji) to the touch control areas so users know where to touch.

**GitHub Commit Summary:**
fix: Improve iPhone touch controls with preventDefault

Adds preventDefault() to touch events and visual indicators to fix iOS Safari touch control issues.
