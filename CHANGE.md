**Prompt:** Let's go ahead and create an emoji Space Evaders game that is similar to Space Invaders. I want to have ships, aliens and different layers. Each time you complete a level, add a timer showing high scores ahead of this. We want to make sure that this is very fun and interactive game that people are able to register their names for their highest scores. We want to go ahead and have it have many visual effects. Explosions, glowing effects, a star field in the background. Make sure that we use a full keyboard control for left and right arrow keys, P to pause and the spacebar to shoot.

**Reasoning:**
This change creates the initial file structure for the Emoji Space Evaders game. It includes the HTML for the game canvas and high score display, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

**Changed:**
- Created `index.html` to serve as the entry point for the game.
- Created `style.css` to style the game elements.
- Created `game.js` to contain the game logic.
- Created `CHANGE.md` to track changes.

**Prompt:** I need to be able to restart the gameplay, give me a nice fun button that will encourage me to play again, period. I also want to be able to play this from an iPhone and Android please. Add this functionality.

**Reasoning:**
This change adds a "Play Again" button and touch controls for mobile devices. The game over screen now presents a "Play Again" button. When a high score is achieved, the "Play Again" button is shown after the user saves their score. Touch controls for left, right, and shoot are added for mobile devices.

**Changed:**
- Added a "Game Over" modal with a "Play Again" button to `index.html`.
- Added touch control elements to `index.html`.
- Added CSS for the touch controls in `style.css`.
- Updated `game.js` to handle the "Play Again" functionality and touch events.
- Modified the `endGame` function to show the correct modal.
- Added a `resetGame` function to restart the game.

**Prompt:** I don't see a playagain option. I did reload and tried flushing My cash.

**Reasoning:**
The user is reporting that the "Play Again" option is not appearing. The previous logic would only show the high score modal if the score was greater than the lowest high score, but it didn't handle the case where the score was not a high score. This change ensures that if the score is not a high score, the "Game Over" modal with the "Play Again" button is displayed. It also ensures that the high score modal is only shown for scores greater than 0.

**Changed:**
- Modified the `endGame` function in `game.js` to correctly display either the high score modal or the game over modal.
- Removed the now redundant `checkHighScore` function.

**GitHub Commit Summary:**
fix: Ensure play again option is always available

Fixes a bug where the "Play Again" button would not appear if the player did not achieve a high score. The game over screen is now correctly displayed when the score is not a high score.

**Prompt:** When the aliens reach the bottom, the game level is over.

**Reasoning:**
This change adds a condition to end the game if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen. This is a standard feature in Space Invaders-style games and adds a sense of urgency for the player.

**Changed:**
- Added a check in `game.js` to determine if any alien has reached the bottom of the canvas. If so, the game ends.

**Modified Files:**
- `d:\Development\git_source\Jairo_Demo\game.js`
- `d:\Development\git_source\Jairo_Demo\CHANGE.md`

**GitHub Commit Summary:**
